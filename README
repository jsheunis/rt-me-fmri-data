### A task and resting state dataset for real-time, multi-echo fMRI methods development and validation

---

A multi-echo fMRI dataset (N=28 healthy volunteers) with four task-based and two resting state runs was collected,
curated and made available to the community.

Its main purpose is to advance the development of methods for real-time multi-echo fMRI analysis with applications in neurofeedback,
real-time quality control, and adaptive paradigms, although the variety of experimental task paradigms can support multiple use cases.
Tasks include finger tapping, emotional face and shape matching, imagined finger tapping and imagined emotion processing.

[The data article]("link to follow") provides a detailed description of the full dataset; methods to collect, prepare, standardize and preprocess it; quality control measures; and data validation measures.
A web-based application is provided as a supplementary tool with which to interactively explore, visualize and understand the data and its derivative measures: [https://rt-me-fmri.herokuapp.com/](https://rt-me-fmri.herokuapp.com/).
